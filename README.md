# EBRecipes

EBRecipes is a create-react-app that allows a user to enter a URL containing a recipe -- the recipe, via the cookbook.io API, will then be separated into corresponding, managable JSON Objects containing fields such as "recipe name," "ingredients," etc. that will in the future hold the capacity to be searched, filtered, and sorted. Recipes are stored in Firebase's Realtime Database (NoSQL).
